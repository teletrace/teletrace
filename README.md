## ‚≠êÔ∏è **Why Lupa?**

Lupa is built from the ground up for modern applications. It is open-source and relies on open standards like OpenTelemetry. It is an easy-to-deploy scalable solution, that supports multiple storage options.

Lupa is developed and maintained by the [Epsagon](https://epsagon.com/) group (acquired by Cisco Systems, Inc).
We believe distributed tracing has an enormous amount of value for modern stacks, and yet presents many challenges like scale and usability.

We are a highly dedicated group of developers, with years of experience in distributed tracing. Open-sourcing knowledge and engaging the community around tracing is our mission.

## ‚ú® **Features**

- Advanced search to pinpoint slow and failing requests.
- Visualize requests to understand their context in your application.
- Track user requests and data across your application.
- Visualize and compare latency and error trends. (Coming Soon)
- Advanced latency analysis tools. (Coming Soon)

## üöÄ **Getting started**

### Requirements

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Using Docker

> Currently, we do not have a public image, so all examples assume execution from the root directory

Clone the project

```sh
git clone https://github.com/epsagon/lupa.git
```

Using docker-compose:

```sh
docker-compose -f deploy/docker-compose/docker-compose.yml up
```

Alternatively, using docker CLI:

```sh
docker build -f cmd/all-in-one/Dockerfile -t oss-tracing:latest .
docker run \
    -v $(pwd)/lupa-otelcol/config/default-config.yaml:/etc/config.yaml \
    -p 8080:8080 \
    -p 4317:4317 \
    -p 4318:4318 \
    oss-tracing:latest \
    --config /etc/config.yaml
```

In case you want to run docker file with environment variables:

```sh
docker run \
    -v $(pwd)/lupa-otelcol/config/default-config.yaml:/etc/config.yaml \
    -p 9090:9090 \
    -p 4317:4317 \
    -p 4318:4318 \
    -e API_PORT=9090 \
    -e DEBUG=false \
    oss-tracing:latest \
    --config /etc/config.yaml
```
