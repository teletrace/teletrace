Lupa is leveraging [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) as an open-source standard for collecting high-quality, ubiquitous telemetry data from microservice applications.

# 1. [OpenTelemetry Collector](../OpenTelemetry Collector)

If you already have OpenTelemtry setup on your applications and are using your own [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/getting-started/ "OpenTelemetry Collector"), this method will allow you to configure it to send data to Lupa.

# 2. [OpenTelemetry SDK](../OpenTelemetry-SDK/JavaScript)

Instrument your application with OpenTelemetry and start sending data to Lupa.
