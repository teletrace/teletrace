# Introduction

This guide will give you the basic knowledge of what is distributed tracing,
what are the different components used to achieve full observability into your application,
how to set them up and a basic overview of the different terms that will be used throughout this documentation.

As a general note, Teletrace is based on the popular [CNCF][1] project [OpenTelemetry][2] and we recommend heading
to their [documentation][2] site as well to get a more in-depth understanding of the observability landscape.

## Topics we will cover

- We will start be covering what is [distributed tracing](./distributed-tracing.md) in concept,
  what are the benefits of using distributed tracing for troubleshooting and the different tools that exists.
- We will go over what is OpenTelemetry instrumentation and the different ways we can instrument our code.
- Finally we will display a [glossary](./glossary.md) of related terms.
