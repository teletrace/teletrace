# Understand The Basics

Before effectively using Teletrace, it is necessary to understand the underlying technology that the platform is built on. It is also necessary to understand the features being provided to you and how to use them. The section below provides some useful links to build up this understanding.

## Learn The Fundamentals

- OpenTelemetry is a set of open-source observability tools that allows you to capture, analyze, and export telemetry data from your applications and infrastructure. You should have a basic understanding of OpenTelemetry and how it works, including its instrumentation and exporter components.
  - [OpenTelemetry documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/)
- Elasticsearch is a distributed, open-source search and analytics engine that can be used to store and analyze Teletrace tracing data. You should have a basic understanding of Elasticsearch and how it works, including knowledge of Elasticsearch indices and data storage.
  - [Elasticsearch documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/index.html)
- Go through the online Docker and Kubernetes tutorials:
  - [A Beginner-Friendly Introduction to Containers, VMs and Docker](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/a-beginner-friendly-introduction-to-containers-vms-and-docker-79a9e3e119b)
  - [Introduction to Kubernetes](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-kubernetes)
  - [Tutorials](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/)
- Depending on how you plan to run Teletrace in your environment:
  - [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/)
  - [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
  - [Helm](https://helm.sh)

By learning these technologies, you'll be able to use Teletrace with OpenTelemetry to capture and analyze telemetry data from your applications and infrastructure, allowing you to monitor and troubleshoot your microservices-based applications more effectively.
