Let's assume you're familiar with core Git, Docker, Kubernetes
Below are some of the concepts that are specific to Teletrace and Observability.

- **Telemetry Data** Telemetry data refers to the data collected from various sources, including application logs, metrics, and traces, to monitor and diagnose the performance and behavior of distributed systems. In the context of Teletrace, telemetry data is primarily collected through tracing, where individual requests are traced across various microservices.
- **Trace** A trace is a collection of spans that represent the path of a request through the distributed system. Each span contains information about a particular operation, including its start and end time, the service that performed the operation, and any relevant metadata, such as the request headers and response status code.
- **Span** A span represents a single operation within a trace. It contains a start and end time, a unique identifier, the name of the operation, and any relevant metadata. Spans can also have parent-child relationships to represent the hierarchical structure of a distributed system.
- **Distributed Tracing** Distributed tracing is a technique that allows developers to track the flow of requests across multiple services in a distributed system. It involves instrumenting your code to generate tracing data and collecting that data in a central location for analysis and visualization.
- **Trace Context** Trace context refers to the information that is passed between services to correlate tracing data across service boundaries. It includes a trace ID, which uniquely identifies a trace, and a span ID, which identifies a specific span within a trace.
- **Open Telemetry** Open Telemetry is an open-source observability framework that allows you to collect telemetry data from various sources, including application code, infrastructure, and platforms. It provides a vendor-agnostic API for collecting telemetry data, making it easier to switch between different tracing systems like Teletrace.
- **Instrumentation** In the context of distributed tracing, instrumentation involves adding code(Open Telemetry SDK) to your application to generate tracing data, including span and trace IDs, and to propagate this data across service boundaries. This tracing data is then collected and processed by a tracing system like Teletrace to provide insights into the behavior of the distributed system.
- **Sending Data to Teletrace** Teletrace receives telemetry data in the form of traces, which can be sent using a tracing client library. These libraries are available for various programming languages, including Java, Python, and Go. The client library automatically instruments your code to capture tracing data, which is then sent to the Teletrace backend for processing and visualization.
- **Value for Developers**
  Teletrace provides several benefits to developers, including:

      * Debugging: Teletrace allows developers to identify and diagnose issues within their distributed system quickly. With tracing data, they can see the flow of requests across service boundaries and identify bottlenecks or errors in individual services.

      * Performance Optimization: Teletrace provides insights into the performance of individual services and the system as a whole. Developers can use this data to identify performance issues and optimize their code for better performance.

      * Monitoring: Teletrace provides real-time monitoring of distributed systems, allowing developers to detect issues as soon as they occur. It also allows them to set up alerts for specific events, such as errors or slow requests.

In summary, before you start working with Teletrace, it's essential to understand the fundamental concepts of telemetry data, trace, span, and Open Telemetry. These concepts are critical to understanding how Teletrace works and the value it provides to developers. With Teletrace, developers can monitor, debug, and optimize their distributed systems effectively.
