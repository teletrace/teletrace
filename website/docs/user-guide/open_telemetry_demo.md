# Teletrace OpenTelemtry Demo

## Introduction

Welcome to Teletrace OpenTelemetry Demo! OpenTelemetry is a set of APIs, libraries, agents, and instrumentation to provide observability for applications and Teletrace is an open-source troubleshooting tool based on traces, designed for cloud-native distributed applications. This demo provides an overview of how to use OpenTelemetry in a sample application to trace and monitor distributed systems via Teletrace.
